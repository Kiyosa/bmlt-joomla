DESCRIPTION
-----------
	This is the Joomla Component for the BMLT.
	
LICENSE
-------
	This code is GPLV3.

INSTALLATION
------------
	The BMLT Joomla! plugin comes as three components: 2 plugins and a component.
	
	As of version 1.2.17, they are all installed and uninstalled by a single file. Simply install the "bmlt.zip" file.
	In order to uninstall, uninstall the component only. It will take care of the plugins.
	
	One plugin is a system plugin, and is required for all installs. BMLT won't work
	unless you install it and activate it.
	
	The other plugin is optional. It is an inline content plugin that allows you to
	insert an HTML comment (<!--BMLT-->) or a shortcode ([[BMLT]]) into the text of an article, and a
	BMLT search will appear there, in the same manner as the WordPress plugin.
	
	The component is required. It contains the administrative interface, as well as
	some important files that are necessary for the inline content plugin to work.
	
USAGE
-----
	The component is fairly straightforward. You simply specify "option=com_bmlt"
	in your URI, and a page opens up that is nothing but a full BMLT implementation.
	
	The inline plugin is a bit more involved, but gives you tremendous flexibility.
	In order to use it, you use the HTML view of an article to enter the following HTML text:
	<!--BMLT-->
	or
	[[BMLT]]
	This will integrate the BMLT directly into your page. You will probably need to play
	with the CSS in order to make it work properly in your page (See the commented-out section
	in the component's style.cpp file).
	
CHANGELIST
----------
2.2.3

    - Made the installer Joomla 2.5 native.
    
2.2.2

    - Fixed a nasty bug in the admin interface that could create multiple empty settings.
    
2.2.1
    - March 28, 2012
    - Added an alert to the new map search, so that users are informed when there were no meetings found.
    
2.2
    - December 31, 2011
    - Moved the Joomla plugin to GitHub
    - Introduces some fixes for validation errors in the new map search.
    - Removed some errant CSS.
    - Now strip out the [[bmlt_mobile]] shortcode if the page is not a mobile page. This allows the shortcode to be used, as the comment version is stripped by "code cleaners."
